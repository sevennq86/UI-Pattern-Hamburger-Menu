# UI-Pattern-Hamburger-Menu

## Description
Project #3 for General Assembly Software Engineering Immersive course.  I utilized the hamburger menu UI with the dog API to make the site.  Click on the menu then click on the breed to see random images, its as simple as that!

## Challenges
Creating the Javascript which incorporates the breed name when a link is clicked and returns the random image from the API.  Also, there are many ways I found to create a hamburger menu so finding a simple one took some time.
